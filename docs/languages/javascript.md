# JavaScript

**JavaScript** is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for client-side web development. It enables interactive and dynamic behavior in web pages, allowing developers to build rich and engaging user interfaces. Here's a brief overview:

- **Dynamic Typing**: JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning variables can hold values of any data type without explicit declaration. This flexibility allows for rapid development and simplifies the code.

- **Prototype-based**: JavaScript follows a prototype-based object-oriented programming model. Objects are created by cloning existing objects and extending their behavior through prototype chains.

- **Functional and Object-Oriented**: JavaScript supports both functional and object-oriented programming paradigms. Functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.

- **Event-Driven and Asynchronous**: JavaScript is inherently event-driven and supports asynchronous programming patterns through callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax. This enables non-blocking I/O operations, improving the responsiveness of web applications.

- **Client-Side Web Development**: JavaScript is primarily used for client-side web development, where it runs in the browser environment. It manipulates the DOM (Document Object Model) to dynamically update the content and behavior of web pages in response to user actions.

- **Server-Side Development**: With the advent of technologies like Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side development. Node.js allows JavaScript to run on the server, enabling developers to build scalable and high-performance backend systems.

- **Libraries and Frameworks**: JavaScript has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which facilitate front-end development. On the server-side, frameworks like Express.js and Nest.js are commonly used for building web servers and APIs.

JavaScript is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, powering a vast majority of websites and web applications due to its versatility and ubiquity across different platforms.

### Example

```javascript
// Define a constant variable
const greeting = "Hello, World!";

// Print the greeting to the console
console.log(greeting);
```
