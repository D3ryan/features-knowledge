# Angular

**Angular** is a popular open-source web application framework maintained by Google. It's used for building dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs) and provides a comprehensive solution for front-end development. Here's a brief overview:

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Angular follows a component-based architecture where applications are built by composing reusable and modular components. Each component encapsulates its own logic, UI, and behavior.

- **Two-Way Data Binding**: Angular offers two-way data binding, which means that changes made in the UI are automatically reflected in the underlying data model, and vice versa. This simplifies the process of keeping the UI and data in sync.

- **Dependency Injection**: Angular's dependency injection system helps manage the dependencies of components and services, making code more modular, testable, and maintainable.

- **Directives**: Angular provides built-in directives like ngIf, ngFor, and ngModel that extend HTML with additional functionality and enable developers to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

- **Services**: Angular encourages the use of services to encapsulate reusable functionality that can be shared across components. Services are typically used for tasks such as data fetching, authentication, or business logic.

- **Routing**: Angular's built-in router enables developers to build single-page applications with multiple views. It allows for navigation between different views/components without full page reloads.

- **Forms**: Angular provides powerful features for building and validating forms. It supports both template-driven forms and reactive forms, offering flexibility depending on the complexity of the form.

- **HTTP Client**: Angular includes a built-in HTTP client module for making AJAX requests to backend servers. It simplifies data fetching and communication with RESTful APIs.

Overall, Angular offers a robust framework for building modern web applications with features like data binding, dependency injection, routing, and more, making it a popular choice among developers for building scalable and maintainable applications.

### Example:

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-hello-world",
  template: `
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to Angular!</p>
    </div>
  `,
  styleUrls: ["./hello-world.component.css"],
})
export class HelloWorldComponent {
  name = "User";
}
```
